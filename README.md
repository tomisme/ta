##Mixed Ideas
Lessons have attached resources that move between stages like 'to be completed' and 'to be printed'. This means a list could be generated of 'class sets to be printed for today' or 'things to work on for next week'.

You can set an amount of planned lessons to 'be ahead' to work towards.

Gameification of lesson planning and marking?

Initial target audience: highschool English teachers using Australian curriculum, followed by other teachers

The web app needs to adapt to the teacher (user). It needs to be able to handle being used as just a timetable, just a unit planner, just a day to day lesson planner. Or it can provide a whole suite of modular tools.

The app augments your existing teaching style. It assumes you're good at all parts of your job, but suggests recommended structures based on research into effective teaching methods.

Should activities be further decoupled from lessons? Perhaps a 'lesson' could be simply a set of objectives. Then activities can be attached to the lesson that achieve those objectives.
