##Ideas
Use google drive as resource back end.

Lessons have attached resources that move between stages like 'to be completed' and 'to be printed'. This means a list could be generated of 'class sets to be printed for today' or 'things to work on for next week'.

You can set an amount of planned lessons to 'be ahead' to work towards.

Gameification of lesson planning and marking?
