## Planning a Lesson
### 1. Outline Learning Objectives
- What is the topic of the lesson?
- What do I want students to learn?
- What do I want them to understand and be able to do at the end of class?
- What do I want them to take away from this particular lesson?

Learning objectives should be ranked in rough order of importance:

- What are the most important concepts, ideas, or skills I want students to be able to grasp and apply?
- Why are they important?
- If I ran out of time, which ones could not be omitted?
- And conversely, which ones could I skip if pressed for time?

## 2. Plan Student Activities
- What will I do to explain the topic?
- What will I do to illustrate the topic in a different way?
- How can I engage students in the topic?
- What are some relevant real-life examples, analogies, or situations that can help students understand the topic?
- What will students need to do to help them understand the topic better?

## 3. Formative Assessment
- What questions will I ask students to check for understanding?
- What will I have students do to demonstrate that they are following?
- Going back to my list of learning objectives, what activity can I have students do to check whether each of those has been accomplished?

## Mixed Ideas
Lessons have attached resources that move between stages like 'to be completed' and 'to be printed'. This means a list could be generated of 'class sets to be printed for today' or 'things to work on for next week'.

You can set an amount of planned lessons to 'be ahead' to work towards.

Gameification of lesson planning and marking?

Initial target audience: highschool English teachers using Australian curriculum, followed by other teachers

The web app needs to adapt to the teacher (user). It needs to be able to handle being used as just a timetable, just a unit planner, just a day to day lesson planner. Or it can provide a whole suite of modular tools.

The app augments your existing teaching style. It assumes you're good at all parts of your job, but suggests recommended structures based on research into effective teaching methods.

Should activities be further decoupled from lessons? Perhaps a 'lesson' could be simply a set of objectives. Then activities can be attached to the lesson that achieve those objectives.
